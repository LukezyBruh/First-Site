            <h2 id="text_text">Arataki Itto is a character with powerful Geo—charged attacks
                With his normal and elemental attack, he imposes an effect of 
                Incredible strength on himself, and also uses this effect for successive 
                chopping blows of the Kasagiri Arataka, dealing high periodic damage to the enemy. 
                In the state of an explosion of the elements, the damage of the Arataka increases.</h2>
            <h1 id="text_3">About the character</h1>
            <h2 id="text_text"> While walking through the streets of Hanamizuki, it's hard not to notice a young oni named Arataki Itto.
                 No matter how his horns and loud voice stand out, just in the form of how enthusiastically he plays with the kids, 
                 it's enough not to confuse him with anyone else. And among the busy artisans of Hanamizaki, his idleness is too striking. 
                 Itto calls himself "The first and greatest leader of the famous Hanamizaka Arataka gang." He tried to explain the gang's 
                 activities to the employees of the Tenre commission who came to him about the investigation of a decent street fight, 
                 but his two-minute tirade was interrupted and summed up with a one-word entry: "Unemployed." This characterization 
                 is not entirely accurate: in addition to gang cases not recognized by the shogunate, Itto also takes various small 
                 jobs to make ends meet, working steadily for one day and resting all three. Therefore, it would be more correct 
                 to write "Three-quarters unemployed".
            </h2>
            <h1 id="text_for_icon">Personality</h1>
            <h2 id="text_for_emia">"He may look intimidating, but the kids love him very much. However, he loves to compete. 
                Every time we play with the kids, it comes down to a contest between me and him. For example, 
                who can cook a plate of ramen in one sitting or eat a sour plum and not grimace. The children 
                cheer us up with shouts and try to guess the winner. How can I lose when this is the case?" - Eimiya
